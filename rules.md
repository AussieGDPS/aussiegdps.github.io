# Welcome to AussieGDPS!
Before you start interacting with the community, please bear in mind we have a set list of rules for everyone to follow so we can keep AussieGDPS a safe and welcoming community.
# Language and Conversation Guidelines
- Do not use assaultive language or slurs when talking at any time. This includes verbally abusing someone with degrading names, telling someone to self-harm or other dangerous acts without clear indication of jokes or using extreme language (e.g. c-word).
     - This goes for voice channels too. If you hear a member violating this rule please report them to a moderator with audio evidence (Discord clipping, NVIDIA Shadowplay, etc)
- If you are talking about a sensitive subject please do it discreetly and respectfully. Members who are seen discussing about a sensitive topic in detail or unironically mocking the subject may be timed out.
- Please keep in mind we have a diverse community, so make sure you don't use any hateful language towards groups of any sort. Racism, LGBTQphobia, anti-furry remarks and hate speech in general is not tolerated here.
- No political or religious discussions.
# Media Guidelines
- Do not post NSFW content. This includes, but isn't limited to, sexually suggestive images, extremely graphic fictionalized or real life gore (game footage must be justified), sexualized or graphic nudity (generally speaking classic art depicting some nudity and incidental animal nudity should be fine), depictions of drug usage and NSFW bait (e.g. "Don't Google this").
- Do not post anything that contains illegal material, such as terrorist instructions and how to make drugs.
- Most pictures should go in #media. Stop spamming femboys in #general. Please. For the love of heck.
# Link Guidelines
You may post only links from video sharing sites and social media (unless there is context). Discord server invites aren't permitted. If you would like to promote your server contact Aussier and he might be able to arrange a partnership.
# Common Sense Guidelines
- Please make sure you don't get into heated arguments with other members. Debates are okay but if they get too much moderators may shut it down.
- Don't act generally immature in general and don't make jokes about being underage. Members seen making jokes about being underage will be banned.
- Don't spam messages, text walls or copypastas in chat.
- The staff members have the final say in a decision. Please don't argue with staff members' decisions unless you truly believe you were punished incorrectly.
